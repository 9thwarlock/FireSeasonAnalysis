As detailed in a Reuters article discussing the state’s fire problem, scientists from the American Geophysical Union have found that the number of acres burned by wildfire in the state has increased fivefold since 1970. The increase in acres burned is attributed to climate change as hotter weather dries the land causing vegetation to become easily ignitable and hot winds to spread flames."

Shortly after the destruction caused by Camp Fire, home prices in the nearby city of Chico rose by 21%. Alongside this the homeless population of the city also rose by 16 percent as people weren't able to afford homes in the city. Low income families and retirees had settled in the towns destroyed by Camp Fire due to their affordability, however this same factor could not be found in places like Chico. Chico wasn't the local place unaffordable to those seeking to relocate as the neighboring Glenn and Tehama counties saw their average home price increase by 47% and 58% respectively."
